This is a setup script for [Freelancer: HD Edition](https://github.com/BC46/freelancer-hd-edition). It was created using Inno Setup and uses custom Pascal scripting.

## Build instructions
### All-in-one installer (default)
1. Clone the [Freelancer: HD Edition GitHub repository](https://github.com/BC46/freelancer-hd-edition).
2. Place all the mod files (DATA & EXE directories, etc.) in a folder named `freelancer-hd-edition-0.6`.
3. Compress the `freelancer-hd-edition-0.6` folder using an archiver like [7-Zip](https://www.7-zip.org/). NOTE: The zip must NOT be larger than 2.05 GB!
    1. Compressing the folder using LZMA2 is highly recommended.
4. Alternatively to step 1, 2, and 3, you may download a pre-packaged zip here: https://archive.org/download/freelancer-hd-edition-0.6/freelancer-hd-edition-0.6.7z. Keep in mind that this zip may not contain the most recent mod changes.
5. Name the zip `freelancerhd.7z` and place it in `Assets/Mod`.
6. Build `setup.iss` using [Inno Setup's standard IDE](https://jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php), or use the [Command Line Compiler](https://jrsoftware.org/ishelp/index.php?topic=compilercmdline).

### Online and offline installer
1. Open `setup.iss` and find line 13. It should look like `#define AllInOneInstall true`.
2. Change this line to `#define AllInOneInstall false`.
3. Build `setup.iss` using [Inno Setup's standard IDE](https://jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php), or use the [Command Line Compiler](https://jrsoftware.org/ishelp/index.php?topic=compilercmdline).
